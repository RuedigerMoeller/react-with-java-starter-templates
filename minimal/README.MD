# Minimal React App Template

Minimal react example with jnpm/bundling/hot reloading. Uses a stateless single threaded Actor Server.

Just add e.g. `import { Card, Icon, Button } from 'semantic-ui-react'` to a jsx file, then refresh app in browser in
order to let jnpm download and install the required dependency.
